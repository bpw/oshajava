System requirements:
Java 1.6 or higher 

To build:
$ ant

You also may wish to use the included Eclipse project, though it does
not do the full jar/tools build.

To use:
After building, you should source setup.sh in any shell in which you
want to use oshajava. This puts a couple things on your path:

  * oshajavac: Use this in place of javac to compile java files that
    use oshajava annotations.  Alternatively, use javac and make sure
    that $OSHAJAVA_ANNOTATION_CLASSPATH is on your classpath.

  * oshajava: Use this in place of java to run a java program under
    the oshajava runtime. Usage is slightly different from java:
        oshajava [java args] -- ClassToRun [application args]
    runs the same program that you would run with normal java as:
    	java [java args] ClassToRun [application args]
