Required:
  * Java 1.6 or higher
  * ant
  * sh (or compatible shell)
 
Build:
$ ant

Usage:
After building, you should source setup.sh in any shell in which you
want to use oshajava. This puts a couple things on your path:

  * oshajavac: Use this in place of javac to compile java files that
    use oshajava annotations.  Alternatively, use javac and make sure
    that $OSHAJAVA_ANNOTATION_CLASSPATH is on your classpath.

  * oshajava: Use this in place of java to run a java program under
    the oshajava runtime. Usage is slightly different from java:
        oshajava [oshajava args] [-javaOptions [java args]] -- ClassToRun [application args]
    runs the same program that you would run with normal java as:
    	java [java args] ClassToRun [application args]
    For running jars:
    	oshajava [oshajava args] -javaOptions [java args] -jar jartorun.jar [application args]
    For help:
    	oshajava -help
